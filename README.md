# OpenCV-Python

These are all the mini-tasks i performed while learning image processing using openCV-python.
I have omitted the very basic tasks like importing image or video and grasyscaling them.

## Pre-requisites

`pip3 install opencv-python`

`pip3 install numpy`

`pip3 install matplotlib`

## How to Run

`python3 file-name.py`

replace file-name by the file which you want to run.

Whatever i have learnt is from Youtube channel- SENTDEX.
